    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Gordan Ramsay has a special recipe for scrambled eggs. His recipe involves cooking the egg slowly so that the final result is much creamier and softer than normal scrambled eggs.</p>

        <p>I first discovered Ramsay's scrambled eggs recipe through Youtube a few years ago. Ever since, I've cooked his scrambled eggs countless times, which is my personal testament to how delicious they are.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 eggs</li>
            <li>15g butter</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Crème fraîche</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Crack the eggs into a bowl and mix them thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Pour the eggs into a buttered pan.</li>
            <li>Cook the eggs under low-medium heat and stir constantly.</li>
            <li>Add a table spoon of crème fraîche and stir.</li>
            <li>After the eggs are slightly cooked, lift the pan off the stove for 20 seconds.</li>
            <li>Put the pan back onto the stove and cook for another 20 seconds.</li>
            <li>Repeat Steps 5 and 6 until the eggs resemble the picture above.</li>
            <li>That's it! Enjoy your scrambled eggs.</li>
        </ol>
